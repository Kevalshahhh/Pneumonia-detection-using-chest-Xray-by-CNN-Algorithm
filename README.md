# Pneumonia-detection-using-chest-Xray-by-CNN-Algorithm
In Deep Learning, CNN Algorithm will be used to detect pneumonia using chest Xrays.  

Here we used CNN Algorithm which gave us a Accuracy of 86.86%  
In CNN Algorithm we use 2 layers of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D.  

Language Used: Python  
IDE: Jupyter Notebook  

Process to Install Dataset and Run the code -

Download the Dataset from Kaggle or from given link:  
" https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia "  

Open the main file in Jupyter Notebook and then run the whole program again. It will take time to train the Algorithm. And then from the input file choose any image you want to check by selecting and providing that path location.
